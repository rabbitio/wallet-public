          <br>Cookies are small files that a Website or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you have permitted) that enables the Website's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are widely used in order to make Websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the Website.

          <br><br>For the purposes of continuous optimization of the Website, RABBIT.IO uses the web analysis service of “Google Analytics”. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google Inc., a company of the holding company Alphabet Inc., in the USA, that tracks and reports Website traffic.

          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Disclosing and Transferring personal data</b>
          <br>We may disclose your personal data to third parties and legal and regulatory authorities, and transfer your personal data outside the EEA, as described below.
          <br><br>There are certain circumstances where we may transfer your personal data to employees, contractors and to other parties.
          <br><br>We may also share your information with certain contractors or service providers. They may process your personal data for us, for example, if we use a marketing agency. Other recipients/service providers include advertising agencies, IT specialists, database providers, backup and disaster recovery specialists, email providers or outsourced call centers. Our suppliers and service providers will be required to meet our standards on processing information and security. The information we provide them, including your information, will only be provided in connection with the performance of their function.
          <br><br>Your personal data may be transferred to other third-party organizations in certain scenarios:
          <br><ul>
            <li>If we're discussing selling or transferring part or all of our business – the information may be transferred to prospective purchasers under suitable terms as to confidentiality;</li>
            <li>If we are reorganized or sold, information may be transferred to a buyer who can continue to provide services to you;</li>
            <li>If we're required to by law, or under any regulatory code or practice we follow, or if we are asked by any public or regulatory authority – for example the Police;</li>
            <li>If we are defending a legal claim your information may be transferred as required in connection with defending such claim.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Your personal data may be shared if it is made anonymous and aggregated, as in such circumstances the information will cease to be personal data.
          <br><br>Your information will not be sold, exchanged, or shared with any third parties without your consent, except to provide RABBIT.IO Services or as required by law.
          <br><br>If a service provider is located in a country that does not apply the standard of data protection of Swiss law and GDPR, RABBIT.IO will use a contract to ensure that your personal data has the same level of protection as if protected in accordance with Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection and EU General Data Protection Regulation.
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">How Personal Information is Shared with Third Party Websites and Services</b>
          <br>Please note that merchants you interact with may have their own privacy policies. Hence RABBIT.IO is not responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.
          <br><br>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as contact details or location data, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those third parties.
          <br><br>If you authorize one or more third-party applications to access your RABBIT.IO Account, then information you have provided to RABBIT.IO may be shared with those third parties. Unless you provide further authorization, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using RABBIT.IO Services.
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Transfer of Data</b>
          <br>We store and process your personal data in data centers around the world, wherever we have our premises or service providers are located.
          <br><br>As such, we may transfer your personal data outside of Switzerland or the European Union. Some of the countries to which your personal data may be transferred do not benefit from an appropriate protection regulation.
          <br><br>These specific countries can be found here: ec.europa.eu
          <br><br>For such international personal data transfer collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland we use approved Contractual Data Protection Clauses, and require that the third party agrees to at least the same level of privacy protection as required under applicable EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and in Switzerland under the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection.
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Security of Data</b>
          <br>We store all your personal data on a server operated by Solar Communications GmbH. We take all reasonable effort on technical and organizational security measures to protect your Data from being manipulated, lost or accessed by unauthorized third parties.
          <br><br>Our Website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our Website as safe as possible.
          <br><br>Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of individuals who have special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.
          <br><br>Although no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is one hundred percent secure, we strive to continually update and improve our security measures with the most recent technological developments.
          <br><br>We would like to draw your attention to the fact that we normally never ask for financial or payment information, such as your credit card number, passcode, account number or pin number, in an e-mail, text or any other communication that we send to you. Please always check that any Website on which you are asked for financial or payment information in relation to our reservations or services is operated by RABBIT.IO. The risk of impersonating hackers exists and should be taken into account when using our Website and/or Services.
          <br><br>If you do receive a suspicious request, do not provide your information and report it by contacting one of our member service representatives as set in this Privacy Policy.
          <br><br>Since we cannot 100% guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur, please accept that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal data. When registering with us, it is important to choose an appropriate password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.
          <br><br>Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us at the email address listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Retention of Data</b>
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Personal Data</b>
          <br>RABBIT.IO will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

          <br><br>Therefore, and in accordance with our record keeping obligations, we will retain account and other personal data for at least five years (and some up to ten years, as required by applicable law) after an account is closed.
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Data Collected Automatically</b>
          <br>RABBIT.IO will also retain data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Website or from the Website infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit)) for internal analysis purposes.
          <br><br>This Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Services, or we are legally obligated to retain this Data for longer time periods.
          <br><br>Hence, this kind of data collected via technical means such as cookies, webpage counters and other analytics tools is normally kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.
          <br><br><b  class="docs-title">Disclosures Due to Legal Compliance</b>
          <br>RABBIT.IO complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.
          <br><br>RABBIT.IO may be compelled to surrender personal user or customer information to legal authorities without express user consent if presented with a court order or similar legal or administrative order, or as required or permitted by the laws, rules, and regulations of any nation, state, or other applicable jurisdiction.
          <br><br>Also, in the event of a violation of the Terms & Conditions of use of the Website or a violation of any restrictions on use of materials provided in or through the Website, we may disclose personal user information to our affected business partners or legal authorities.
