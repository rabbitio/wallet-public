                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Use of the RABBIT Wallet</b>
                    <br>After registering on the RABBIT.IO Website and/or downloading the RABBIT Wallet application and being duly registered as a user, you can access an existing wallet by entering your password or create a new wallet.
                    <br><br>RABBIT.IO does not have, at any point in time, access to the users’ funds and/or passwords. If you lose access to your device, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any crypto-asset associated with that RABBIT Wallet will become inaccessible, unless you have created a backup of the RABBIT Wallet by writing down the wallet’s mnemonic words and passphrase. “Mnemonic words” is a list of words which store all the information needed to recover funds on-chain. Passphrase can be created by the user to improve security. The RABBIT Wallet may typically generate mnemonic words and instruct the user to write it down on paper. If passphrase is used during the wallet creation then it should be written down too. You expressly acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for safekeeping your device, including the prompt and timely installation of any updates or patches as necessary, and taking reasonable steps to keep the details you use to access the RABBIT Wallet and/or Digital assets safe to prevent their fraudulent use. If you suspect or become aware that the details that you use to access the RABBIT Wallet and/or Digital assets has been lost, stolen, compromised, used without your authorisation, or used fraudulently, you must contact us immediately through the channels listed at the end of these Terms.
                    <br><br>RABBIT.IO does not hold any digital assets of the user. Only the User itself can access and control its RABBIT Wallet. Therefore, you are solely responsible for keeping and securing your access to the RABBIT Wallet. The balance of digital assets displayed by the RABBIT Wallet in the user interface of your application is accurate and the balance represents the current amount of digital assets you are able to transfer or exchange. The orders of transfers that you perform using the RABBIT Wallet are final and cannot be canceled, returned or refunded.
                    <br><br>If you are a representative of a corporation, governmental organization or other legal entity, you may be required to prove that you have the right, power and authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of the corporation, governmental organization or other legal entity and to legally bind it to these Terms.
                    <br><br>In addition, RABBIT.IO may require you to provide documentation to verify the information you have submitted to RABBIT.IO including, without limitation, an identification card or a passport, a utility bill, a bank statement or any document proving your identity issued by a governmental body.
                    <br><br>Moreover, your access and/or use of the RABBIT Wallet is subject to international economic sanctions requirements. By accessing and/or using the RABBIT Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that you will comply with those requirements.

RABBIT.IO encourages you to seek legal, tax, technical and financial advice from professionals prior engaging in transactions with your RABBIT Wallet. RABBIT.IO does not recommend that any digital asset should be bought, earned, sold, or held by you.

RABBIT.IO will not be held responsible for the decisions you make to buy, sell, or hold any digital asset based on the information provided by RABBIT.IO.
                    <br><br>In addition, it is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any and all transactions associated with your receipt or transfer of digital assets, and/or to the transactions you conduct, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. RABBIT.IO is not obligated to, and will not determine whether, and to what extent, taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction.

                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Indemnification</b>
                    <br>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless RABBIT.IO, their affiliates, contractors, licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any claims, actions, proceedings, investigations, demands, suits, costs, expenses and damages (including attorneys’ fees, fines or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of or related to (i) your use of, or conduct in connection with the RABBIT Wallet, (ii) your breach or our enforcement of these Terms, or (iii) your violation of any applicable law, regulation, or rights of any third party during your use of the RABBIT Wallet.

                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Termination of your RABBIT Wallet account</b>
                    <br>Unless otherwise provided herein, your access and use of RABBIT Wallet will remain valid until termination of these Terms by either You or by RABBIT.IO.
                    <br><br>You are free to terminate these Terms at will at any given time.
                    <br><br>In case of any of the following events, RABBIT.IO shall have the right to immediately terminate these Terms, without prior notice:
                    <ul>

                        <li>If RABBIT.IO terminates its services in accordance with these Terms;</li>
                        <li>If, after termination of these Terms, you allegedly register or register in any other person’s name as a user of the RABBIT Wallet again, directly or indirectly;</li>
                        <li>If the information that you have provided is untruthful, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete;</li>
                        <li>If, after a material change of a regulation, a civil, criminal and/or administrative practice or any other event the operation of the Wallet by RABBIT becomes illegal;</li>
                        <li>When these Terms are amended, you state your unwillingness to accept the amended Terms by applying for cancellation of your RABBIT Wallet or by other means;</li>
                        <li>If you request your contractual relationship with RABBIT.IO to be terminated; and</li>
                        <li>Any other circumstances where RABBIT.IO deems, in its sole discretion, that it should terminate the services relating to the RABBIT Wallet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>In the case these Terms are terminated by RABBIT.IO, you will be notified via in-app notification and given a deadline to ensure that you take all necessary measures to keep access to your funds. After expiry of the deadline, your access to the Services will be removed.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Miscellaneous</b>
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">No Partnership</b>
                    <br>RABBIT.IO is an independent contractor but not an agent of you in the performance of these Terms. These Terms shall not be interpreted as facts or evidence of an association, joint venture, partnership, or franchise between the parties.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Communications</b>
                    <br>In principle, we do not communicate with you but we leave you the ability to contact us. When doing so, you agree and consent to receive electronically via your e-mail all communications that RABBIT.IO may be willing to communicate to you, including any communication, agreement, document, receipt, notice and disclosure, which may be from time to time addressed to you by RABBIT.IO.
                    <br><br>It is your responsibility to keep your email address on file with RABBIT.IO so that we can communicate with you. You understand and agree that you forfeit the right to plead ignorance if you do not receive an electronic communication sent to you by RABBIT.IO because your email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or because you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Severability</b>
                    <br>If any portion of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability will not affect the other provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable portion will be given effect to the greatest extent possible.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Waiver</b>
                    <br>Failure of one party to require performance of any provision will not affect that party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter. At the same time, the waiver of one party to seek recovery for the other party’s violation of these Terms or any provision of applicable terms shall not constitute a waiver by that party of any subsequent breach or violation by the other party or of the provision itself.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Third-Party Websites</b>
                    <br>Any possible links to third-party websites from the RABBIT Wallet or the Website do not imply endorsement by RABBIT.IO of any product, service, information or disclaimer presented therein, nor does RABBIT.IO guarantee the accuracy of the information contained on them. If you suffer loss from using such third-party product and service, RABBIT.IO will not be liable for such loss. In addition, since RABBIT.IO has no control over the terms of use or privacy policies of third-party websites, you should read and understand those policies carefully.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">Applicable law and Jurisdiction</b>
                    <br>These Terms and the use of the Website and the App will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Switzerland without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule.
