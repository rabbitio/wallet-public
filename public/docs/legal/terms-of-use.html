                            The present Terms of Use (“Terms”), last updated May 2021, govern the relationship between
                            you (“User”) and RABBIT WALLET (“RABBIT WALLET”, “us” or “we”), a company organized and
                            existing under the laws of Switzerland and registered office in Geneva, Switzerland, and
                            define the rights and obligations of the parties in connection with the use of the RABBIT
                            WALLET, located at wallet.rabbit.io (“Website”). <br /><br />These Terms constitute a legal
                            agreement and create a binding contract between you and RABBIT WALLET. By using, attempting
                            to use, and directly or indirectly interacting with the RABBIT WALLET users, you explicitly
                            acknowledge and agree to these Terms, as amended and published on the Website. You
                            acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms. If you do not agree with these
                            Terms, do not use the RABBIT WALLET. <br /><br />These Terms may be updated by RABBIT
                            WALLET, in its sole discretion, at any time without any prior notice requirement. The
                            current version of the Terms, as published on the Website, is applicable. In case of
                            amendments to these Terms, your continued use of the RABBIT WALLET is deemed your acceptance
                            of the modified agreement and rules. If you do not agree with such amendments, you must stop
                            using the RABBIT WALLET immediately. <br /><br /><b class="docs-title"

                                    manner.

                            <br />You hereby further agree and acknowledge that the violation of the aforementioned
                            representations and warranties may result in the initiation of termination proceedings in
                            accordance with these Terms. <br /><br /><b class="docs-title">Use of the RABBIT WALLET</b>
                            <br />After registering on the RABBIT WALLET Website and/or downloading the RABBIT WALLET
                            application and being duly registered as a user, you can access an existing wallet by
                            entering your password or create a new wallet. <br /><br />RABBIT WALLET does not have, at
                            any point in time, access to the users’ funds and/or passwords. If you lose access to your
                            device, you expressly acknowledge and agree that any crypto-asset associated with that
                            RABBIT Wallet will become inaccessible, unless you have created a backup of the RABBIT
                            Wallet by writing down the wallet’s mnemonic words and passphrase. “Mnemonic words” is a
                            list of words which store all the information needed to recover funds on-chain. Passphrase
                            can be created by the user to improve security. The RABBIT WALLET may typically generate
                            mnemonic words and instruct the user to write it down on paper. If passphrase is used during
                            the wallet creation then it should be written down too. You expressly acknowledge and agree
                            that you are solely responsible for safekeeping your device, including the prompt and timely
                            installation of any updates or patches as necessary, and taking reasonable steps to keep the
                            details you use to access the RABBIT WALLET and/or Digital assets safe to prevent their
                            fraudulent use. If you suspect or become aware that the details that you use to access the
                            RABBIT WALLET and/or Digital assets has been lost, stolen, compromised, used without your
                            authorisation, or used fraudulently, you must contact us immediately through the channels
                            listed at the end of these Terms. <br /><br />RABBIT WALLET does not hold any digital assets
                            of the user. Only the User itself can access and control its RABBIT WALLET. Therefore, you
                            are solely responsible for keeping and securing your access to the RABBIT WALLET. The
                            balance of digital assets displayed by the RABBIT WALLET in the user interface of your
                            application is accurate and the balance represents the current amount of digital assets you
                            are able to transfer or exchange. The orders of transfers that you perform using the RABBIT
                            WALLET are final and cannot be canceled, returned or refunded. <br /><br />If you are a
                            representative of a corporation, governmental organization or other legal entity, you may be
                            required to prove that you have the right, power and authority to enter into these Terms on
                            behalf of the corporation, governmental organization or other legal entity and to legally
                            bind it to these Terms. <br /><br />In addition, RABBIT WALLET may require you to provide
                            documentation to verify the information you have submitted to RABBIT WALLET including,
                            without limitation, an identification card or a passport, a utility bill, a bank statement
                            or any document proving your identity issued by a governmental body. <br /><br />Moreover,
                            your access and/or use of the RABBIT WALLET is subject to international economic sanctions
                            requirements. By accessing and/or using the RABBIT WALLET, you acknowledge and agree that
                            you will comply with those requirements. <br /><br /><b class="docs-title">Availability</b>
                            <br />RABBIT WALLET shall endeavor, as far as possible, to keep the Website and the RABBIT

                            Website may be temporarily suspended due to technical maintenance, migration or updates, or
                            due to breakdowns or constraints in relation with the operation of the internet and/or the
                            RABBIT WALLET Protocol Suite. RABBIT WALLET is not liable for any malfunction or inability
                            to access the RABBIT WALLET or the Website attributable to third parties, because of

                            information on the RABBIT WALLET and on the Website, the information provided may not always
                            be entirely accurate, complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or
                            typographical errors. Accordingly, the User shall verify all information before relying on
                            it, and all decisions based on information contained on the RABBIT WALLET and the Website
                            are in the sole responsibility of the User and RABBIT WALLET shall have no liability for
                            such decisions. <br /><br />Notwithstanding the above, RABBIT WALLET reserves the right to
                            limit the scope of the services relating to the RABBIT WALLET, in RABBIT WALLET’s sole
                            discretion and without prior notification. Limitation of the services may depend on the
                            established security level of the account. Please also note that certain services might be
                            subject to geographical restrictions and may not be available in your country. In addition,
                            RABBIT WALLET reserves the right to choose markets and jurisdictions to conduct business,
                            and may restrict or refuse, in its sole discretion, access to its RABBIT WALLET services in
