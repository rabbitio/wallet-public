                <div class="landing-top-subtitle docs">Last Updated: October, 2023<br>
                    These Terms of Use and any terms incorporated herein (hereinafter, the “Terms”) apply to your (“user”, “you“) use of the Services, including https://rabbit.io/ (“Website“, “RABBIT.IO”, “We”, or “Us”), the technology and the platform integrated therein and any related applications (including without limitation the mobile one) associated therewith.
                    We provide you with the possibility to use our Services as defined above on the following terms and conditions.
                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">1. Consent to Third-Party Terms of Service</b>

                    <br><br>Your use of RABBIT.IO implies consent to both RABBIT.IO's terms and the terms of SwapSpace.

                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">2. Enforcement & Amendments</b>
                    <br>1. These Terms of Use constitutes a binding agreement between RABBIT.IO and the user as soon as the user visits the Website and uses Services. By doing so, the user confirms that he has read and accepted these Terms of Use in their entirety before using any services provided by RABBIT.IO.
                    <br><br>2. The user accepts that Terms of Use may be updated by RABBIT.IO from time to time. If the user does not read and accept the Terms of Use in its entirety he should not use or continue using the Services.
                    <br><br>3. We reserve the right to alter, amend or modify these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. We will provide you with notice of such changes by providing notice on the homepage of the Website and/or by posting the amended Terms via our Website and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. The amended Terms will be deemed effective immediately upon posting on Website.

                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">3. Provided Services</b>
                    <br>1. Our Services provide you with the possibility to Exchange one type of crypto asset for another one.
                    <br><br>2. For the purposes hereof "Exchange" shall mean an exchange of the crypto asset of one type to the crypto asset of another type at the terms and conditions set forth by exchanging parties, which is executed via the Third-party service in respective block-chain network. When you exchange crypto assets you acknowledge and agree that the Exchange will be processed through the third-party exchange service with additional fees applicable to such Exchange. You acknowledge and agree that the exchange rates information made available via the Services are an estimation only and may differ from prevailing rates available via other sources outside of our Services.
                    <br><br>3. "Crypto Assets" herein shall be deemed as type of assets which can only and exclusively be transmitted by means of block-chain technology, including but not limited to digital coins and digital tokens and any other type of digital mediums of exchange, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc, to the full and absolute exempt of the securities of any kind.
                    <br><br>4. The "Floating exchange rate" option herein shall mean an exchange rate mode in which our platform does not guarantee the rate - so it fluctuates in accordance with the market. You acknowledge and agree that the exchange rate information made available via Services for the Floating exchange rate option is an estimation only and may differ from the actual rates available via other sources outside of our Services. RABBIT.IO cannot guarantee the execution of a Floating exchange rate transaction in some cases, including, but not limited to the following ones:
                    <br>4.1. user sent crypto assets to a previously used one-time address that had been generated for a Floating exchange rate transaction;    
                    <br>4.2. user sent an amount of crypto assets different from the amount to be sent that was displayed on the Website, or did not account for the relevant withdrawal and network fees, thus sending an amount that is too small;    
                    <br>4.3. the user sent crypto assets to a RABBIT.IO floating-rate address later than in 3 hours after the address was provided. RABBIT.IO floating rate addresses cannot be used after the 3 hour mark.    
                    <br>4.4. in order to avoid any substantial losses for the customer caused by the rate change, when a significant disparity between an estimated exchange rate available on the Website and the rate received from a third-party exchange arises, a Floating exchange rate transaction may be failed automatically.
                    <br>If despite the aforementioned cases the market situation allows us to make the exchange, the transaction will be exchanged manually at the new rate. If the market situation is such that the transaction cannot be executed anymore, or if the rate has changed significantly and the user asks for a refund, the crypto assets that the user wants to exchange will be refunded, if at all possible, less all applicable fees. The refund usually takes 1-7 business days (depending on the reason of the failure) to the same address that was used to send coins or the one that was provided before exchange.
                    <br><br>5. In order to perform the Exchange via our Services, our system will automatically generate a particular address for the initiated transaction, which contains information about (i) the user; (ii) the crypto asset that user wants to exchange and the crypto asset that user wants to receive (jointly - "crypto pair"); and (iii) the recipient address provided by the user (the address where exchanged crypto assets will be deposited). The user understands that the crypto assets to be exchanged are transferred only to the particular address provided by the system. The address is active only for one transaction and particularly, the one designated by the system.
                    <br><br>6. The technical issues arising from your misuse of our services, such as creating incorrect transactions (entering a wrong address both when indicating the recipient address and when sending your crypto assets to us), and other types of user mistakes may be resolved by our technical department with limitations. Upon successful resolution of a technical issue, the crypto assets sent incorrectly will be refunded to the user, less all applicable fees.    
                    <br>6.1. RABBIT.IO technical department is able to refund only BTC from the Segwit BTC address. No other crypto assets, including but not limited to, LTC, BSV, BCH sent to a Segwit BTC address could be refunded;    
                    <br>6.2. No crypto assets sent to us via an unsupported and/or not recommended network (e.g. BSC network) can be refunded. Recommended networks will be displayed to you during the transaction process.
                    <br><br>7. You acknowledge and agree that any refund may cause operating costs for the allocated resources required for resolving user issues arising from misuse of our services. RABBIT.IO shall be entitled to recover its operating costs for the services while executing any refund. In this case crypto assets will be refunded to the user, subtracting operating costs and network fees, only with a prior user’s consent.
                    <br><br>8. YOU INDEMNIFY AND HOLD RABBIT.IO HARMLESS AGAINST ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INCORRECT USE OF ADDRESS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS ETC.
                    <br><br>9. RABBIT.IO does not provide custodial services, which means, we do not store your crypto assets on deposits and balances. In limited cases such as e.g. necessity to perform the Exchange manually, your Exchange may be delayed. YOU HEREBY UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT ANY DELAYS ARE POSSIBLE; YOU INDEMNIFY AND HOLD US HARMLESS AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE EXCHANGE DELAY, WHETHER ORIGINATED FROM OUR FAULT OR NOT.

                    <br><br><b class="docs-title">4. Fees</b>
                    <br>1. RABBIT.IO keeps its fee policy transparent. The current fee structure is two-layered and is comprised of exchange and network fees.    
                    <br>1.1. The exchange fee is the amount charged by third-party services for executing transactions initiated by the users. RABBIT.IO finds the best rate available on the market and fixes it for the conversion in question; the respective rate is displayed to the user, thus guaranteeing the protection of users’ funds from market fluctuations during the exchange.
                    <br>1.2. The network fee is paid to cryptocurrency miners for processing transactions in the network, and it serves to ensure withdrawals of the funds from exchanges. RABBIT.IO collects and transfers these payments to respective exchanges, which themselves set the amount of the fee at any particular time. The moment a transaction is created, this fee is displayed to the user, with the amount being based on our estimates. With that, you acknowledge and agree that the final amount of the network fee charged can sometimes differ from our estimate. This occurs entirely due to the volatile nature of network fees prevalent on exchanges and does not depend on our platform in any respect.
